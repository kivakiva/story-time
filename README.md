## story

This was an incredible learning experience for us as junior developers. We are open to coninuing to develop this application post-graduation. Specifically we would like to make the application more rapid on reload, implement some testing with mocha, chai, and jest, and further refine the UI/UX.

Ruta had the first seed of the idea - wanting to use our final project to work on an application to connect people during the pandemic. We then collectively built out the features that now exist
